The steps to follow with the files are:
1) The .ipynb file will be opened using VSCode and Jupyter Notebook.
2) Make sure the data set named heart.csv is in same location where the code is executing.
3) Multiple running of some commands in Jupyter Notebook leads to errors then select runall option in the top menu so that all will execute from first.
4) The hyperparameter tuning might take more time for execution. I am sure that the whole code will execute in less than 4 or 5 minutes.
5) The output of best parameters from gridsearchcv may vary execution to execution. I made the prediction with the parameters, which I got while execution.
6) Thank you..
